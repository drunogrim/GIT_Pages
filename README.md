# Magni Bronzebeard

> "I am still the dwarf I was before, but now me purpose transcends any throne or kingdom."

Magni Bronzebeard is the former king of the dwarven kingdom of Khaz Modan, Thane of Ironforge and head of the Bronzebeard clan. During the Second War he defended Ironforge from the orcs and joined the Alliance of Lordaeron. He was a founding member of the Explorers' League led by his brother Brann and forged the Ashbringer hoping it would avenge his brother Muradin, who was believed to have been killed by Arthas Menethil. Magni was turned to diamond during a ritual in the heart of Old Ironforge, sacrificing himself to save Khaz Modan from the Cataclysm. He was succeeded by the Council of Three Hammers. After years spent immobilized in Old Ironforge, Magni returned as "the Speaker", the ritual having attuned him to the titan world-soul of Azeroth itself, and now works with the world's heroes to heal the world's wounds.
